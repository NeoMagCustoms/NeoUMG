# 🔗 Snap, Merge, Stack: Core Operations in UMG

UMG logic blocks are not just modular — they’re **interactive**.

Every MOLT block can be:
- Snapped with another of a different type  
- Merged with another of the same type  
- Stacked into layered priority or memory

These operations are the core of UMG's dynamic logic engine.

---

## 🧩 Snap

> Snap = combine different types of MOLT blocks into a single logic unit.

Example:

```text
Primary + Subject + Instruction  
= "Generate training schedule" + "Personal Fitness" + "INSTR:USE.INTERVALS.30MIN"
```

Notes:

Snap joins different block types into a single intent  
Used to form coherent modular instructions  
Allows dynamic construction of logic from smaller parts  
Typical Snap chain = Primary + Subject + Instruction + (optional Philosophy or Trigger)

---

## 🔁 Merge

> Merge = reconcile or combine blocks of the same type — if logic aligns.

Example:

```text
Philosophy A: "Respect user intent"  
Philosophy B: "Preserve creative freedom"  
→ Merge into: "Respect user creative intent"
```

Notes:  
Merge is only allowed when logic is compatible  
Merge fails if blocks contradict  
Merge creates stronger, unified logic  
UMG doesn't hide conflict — it invites clarity

---

## 🧱 Stack

> Stack = layer blocks by priority, time, or override context.

Used for:
- Memory hierarchies  
- Rule escalation  
- Execution sequencing

Example:

```text
Instruction (base): "Use default routing"  
Instruction (override): "If power loss, reroute to B-line"

Stacked → override takes precedence if triggered

```
Notes:  
Top of stack = highest priority  
Lower layers act as fallback or memory reference  
Stacking can occur dynamically or via design-time scaffolding  
This is how UMG enables layered cognition and evolving behavior
```

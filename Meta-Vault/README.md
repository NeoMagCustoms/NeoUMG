# ðŸ§  The Meta-Vault

This folder contains internal project records for the development of Universal Modular Generation (UMG).

## Purpose:
- Preserve key origin decisions, logs, and setup history
- Record design intentions, agent philosophy, and IP context
- Store personal notes and reflections during development

While `/docs` is for public-facing documentation, `/meta-vault` serves as a private ledger of the system's evolution.

> UMG is modular thought â€” this is its memory.

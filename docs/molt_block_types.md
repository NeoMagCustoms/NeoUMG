# ðŸ§± MOLT Block Types in UMG

A **MOLT block** is the atomic unit of thought in UMG â€”  
a modular, self-contained logic structure that can be composed, snapped, or stacked.

All UMG-based agents, apps, and tools are built by combining MOLT blocks into working systems.

## ðŸ”¹ Anatomy of a MOLT Block

Each block typically includes:

- `type`: the category of the block  
- `content`: the meaning, instruction, or data  
- *(optional)* `metadata`: versioning, author, timestamps


Example:

```json
{
  "type": "Instruction",
  "content": "INSTR:EXECUTE.ON.TRIGGER:USER.INPUT.RECEIVED"
}

# üîó UMG Integration Targets

This document outlines the technologies, frameworks, and ecosystems into which the Universal Modular Generation (UMG) framework can integrate. UMG‚Äôs modular, snap-compatible architecture allows it to serve as a logic layer, ethics wrapper, or recursive design pattern in a wide variety of technical domains.

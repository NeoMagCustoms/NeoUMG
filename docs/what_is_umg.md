# 🧩 What is UMG?

**UMG** (Universal Modular Generation) is a cognitive and computational framework  
for building composable systems using self-contained logic units called **MOLT blocks**.

UMG enables agents, apps, and ideas to be structured like modular thoughts —  
each block holding specific logic, role, or meaning — and combined with precision.

## 🧱 MOLT: The Core of UMG

Every unit in UMG is a **MOLT block**.

A MOLT is:
- Self-contained
- Categorized by type
- Snappable with other blocks
- Human-readable and agent-executable

### 🔹 MOLT Block Types:
| Type        | Purpose                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `Primary`   | Main intent or directive         |
| `Subject`   | Area of focus                    |
| `Instruction` | Actions, methods, logic         |
| `Philosophy` | Tone, ethics, interpretation     |
| `Trigger`   | Reactive behavior or conditions  |

Each block has:
- A `type` (above)
- A `content` field (freeform or structured)
- A logical identity that can **snap**, **merge**, or **stack** with others

## ⚙️ Core Operations

### 🔗 Snap
> Combine blocks of different types to form executable agents or workflows

### 🔀 Merge
> If two blocks of the same type align in logic, they may merge into a superior form

### 🧠 Stack
> Arrange blocks into prioritized memory or execution layers

## 🛠 Use Cases

UMG can be used in:
- Modular AI agents
- Game logic engines
- Narrative systems
- UI logic planners
- Educational curriculums
- Any system that benefits from **composable cognition**

## 🧪 Example

```json
{
  "type": "Instruction",
  "content": "INSTR:LOAD.BLOCK; PATH=blocks/core_logic.md"
}

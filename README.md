🧠 NeoUMG: Universal Modular Generation Framework

Welcome to NeoUMG, the canonical repository and experimental playground for the Universal Modular Generation (UMG) system — a modular, semantic framework for designing intelligent systems, plans, prompts, and cognitive overlays using snap-fit logic blocks.

🔍 What is UMG?

UMG is a Cognitive Operating System — a modular stack of mergeable logic blocks that represent behavior, tone, strategy, domain, and ethics.

Each block is defined by its molt_type — a role-based identity in the cognition stack. These blocks can snap vertically (hierarchy) or horizontally (overlay), allowing you to plan, modify, or orchestrate complex flows using clear, reusable logic.

UMG enables:

✅ Modular planning (business plans, chatbots, agent strategies)

✅ Ethical overlays (Philosophy blocks)

✅ Layout and tone control (Blueprint blocks)

✅ Strategic behavior injection (Directive blocks)

✅ Prompt scaffolding and AI-agent compatibility

🧩 MOLT Block Types

| MOLT Type   | Function                           |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Primary     | Main directive / intent            |
| Subject     | Topic / domain focus               |
| Instruction | Logic rules / constraints          |
| Directive   | Strategic overlay                  |
| Philosophy  | Ethical tone / worldview           |
| Blueprint   | Style / layout format              |
| Trigger     | Event-based logic activation       |
| Merge       | Data combiner / glue layer         |
| Off         | Muted / sandboxed logic            |

These blocks are composable, editable, and interoperable. Together, they define both the content and the behavior of a plan, system, or agent.

🧠 Key Features

- **Snap Stack:** Combine logic blocks vertically (for structure and execution) and horizontally (for parallel logic and overlays)
- **Merge Engine:** Resolves block conflicts and controls behavior priority (e.g., Trigger > Directive > Instruction...)
- **CantoCore:** Self-aware metadata and snap-fit scoring
- **Meta-Cognition Format:** Blocks encode how to think about content, not just what to output
- **Interoperable by Design:** Structure feels like HTML/CSS/JS — but for cognitive logic

💡 Use Cases

- **Modular Planning:** Business plans or agent behavior logic
- **Ethical AI Design:** Use Philosophy and Directive overlays to guide tone and strategy
- **Prompt Engineering:** Reuse modular blocks to scaffold adaptive prompts
- **Adaptive Agents:** Role-based personality building with modular logic
- **Composable AGI:** Future-facing AI logic infrastructure

🌐 Why NeoUMG?

- **Modular:** Build plans, agents, or prompts with reusable MOLT blocks.
- **Ethical:** PoeUMG’s alignment-first design ensures outputs prioritize ethics (e.g., symbiotic principles).
- **Interoperable:** Snaps with any AI tech (LangChain, GPT-4o, MCP).
